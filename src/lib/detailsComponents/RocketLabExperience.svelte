			Focused on developing applications that allowed increased speed and reliability during the
			production of space grade solar panels. Applications spanned all aspects of the sites needs,
			some highlights include:
		</span>
		<span> - Custom production dashboards focused on visualizing tool data.</span>
		<span>
			- Live and interactive viewers of the factory floor visualizing production bottlenecks, and
			helping managers visualize and achieve key production/cost milestones.</span
		>
		<span>
			- Automating the process of solar panel power simulations, ensuring contract specifications
			were met.</span
		>
		<br />
		<span>
			Team was additionally in charge managing the sites Kubernetes cluster. Deployment pipelines
			were built to make sure a seamless transition between local development, dev Kubernetes
			cluster, and production.</span

	— June 2024-Present Lead development of applications for site needs, with a focus on increasing
	dev speed, app reliability, and improved customer satisfaction. Created an application showing a
	live replica of the fabrication floor allowing for tool status, inventory locations, and more to
	be visually represented. Created a custom tool that quickly stands up local MS SQL dev
	environments based on projects specifications, improving dev speed and the ability to execute end
	to end testing of applications. Improve ability for legacy apps to be maintained by creating and
	maintaining Docker dev environments. Admin Kubernetes cluster and apps hosted on cluster ensuring
	high availability between all the applications and services. Software Engineer I, Solaero
	Technologies By Rocket lab — august 2022-may 2024 Developed projects, working through the complete
	project life cycle from requirements, planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.
	Improved the software team’s project development speed focusing on MVPs providing fast turnaround.
	Projects ranged from, creating global finance APIs, database input applications and creating data
	intensive web-based applications for various departments of fabrication, safety, quality, finance,
	people, and engineering. Architected and setup the sites Kubernetes environment. Deployment
	pipelines use tooling such as Gitlab CI/CD, Argo CD, Kaniko, Docker, and more. Cluster and
	applications were setup with log aggregation and metrics using tools such as Sentry, Umami,
	Glitchtip, Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana. Application developer intern, Solaero Technologies By
	Rocket lab — may 2022-July 2022 Collaborated with Senior Application Developer and Internal
	Customers to develop a full stack web application using SQL, Python, and React Typescript to track
	equipment health. Through the product lifecycle I participated in requirements drafting, testing
	new features, and resolving new bugs that arose during development. Participated in a sprint based
	development cycle and frequent code reviews.
